## Get Started

The project is built on top of the Headless CMS Strapi. To make it work, you should first create a Strapi application.

### Back-end

1. In your terminal, run `npx create-strapi-app backend --quickstart` to create a Strapi project
2. After a moment, it should automatically run a server and open up a browser
3. After you register a new admin user, close the browser. **DO NOT CLOSE THE TERMINAL**
